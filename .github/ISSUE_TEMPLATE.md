You should only file an issue if you found a bug.  Feature and enhancement requests, general discussions and support questions should occur in one of the following areas:

- The ZoneMinder IRC channel - irc.freenode.net #zoneminder
- The [ZoneMinder Forum](https://forums.zoneminder.com/)

Make sure you are running the latest version of ZoneMinder before reporting an issue.

**ZoneMinder Version (`zmaudit.pl -v`):**

**Are you using a development snapshot / git checkout?  If so, what is the latest commit? (`git rev-parse HEAD`):**

**Linux Distribution and Version (`cat /etc/os-release` or `cat /etc/redhat-release`):**
