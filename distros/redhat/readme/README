What's New
==========

1. See the ZoneMinder release notes for a list of new features:
     https://github.com/ZoneMinder/zoneminder/releases

2. The contents of the ZoneMinder Apache config file have changed. In
   addition, this ZoneMinder package now requires you to manually symlink the
   ZoneMinder Apache config file. See new install step 6 and upgrade step 3
   in the appropriate README for details.

3. This package has been split into sub-packages to allow compatibility with
   other web servers. Here is a breakdown of the available packages:

     zoneminder - Meta-package installs zoneminder-common and zoneminder-httpd
                  This exists soley for backwards compatibility.
     zoneminder-common - Common files that do not differ based on the web server
     zoneminder-httpd - Files needed for compatibility with the Apache web server
     zoneminder-nginx - Files needed for compatibility with the Nginx web server

   You can switch between different subpackages with dnf/yum. Be advised that,
   switching between httpd <-> nginx requires manaully changing ownership of
   all event folders and the php session folder after the change.

4. The timezone must now be set from the ZoneMinder web console. See the
   appropriate README, mentioned in the next step, for details.

6. Continue on to the next README that corresponds to your chosen webserver:

     README.httpd - Follow these steps when using Apache
     README.nginx - Follow these steps when using Nginx
