HTTPS is now the default
========================

By default, ZoneMinder will use the certificate created when the mod_ssl
package was installed on your system. 

Since the certificate is self-signed, you will get a warning from your browser
the first time you access the web portal. This is normal.

This is not intended to be an all encompassing solution for everyone. ZoneMinder
will work just fine over HTTPS the way it is currently configured. However,
here are a couple of considerations you may want to take to improve your
experience.

1. Install a fully signed certificate from letsencrypt, using certbot. See the
   certbot site for more information. This free service is very easy to set up.

2. Create your own certificate. The CentOS wiki has a guide that describes how
   to do this: https://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/Https . Additionally, Googling 
   "centos certificate" reveals many articles on the subject.

3. When using Apache, you can turn off HTTPS entirely by simply commenting
   out the SSLRequireSSL directives found in
   /etc/zm/www/zoneminder.apache.conf. You should also comment out the
   HTTP -> HTTPS Rewrite rule.
