Zoneminder for Debian
---------------------

Initializing database
---------------------

    pv /usr/share/zoneminder/db/zm_create.sql | sudo mysql --defaults-file=/etc/mysql/debian.cnf
OR
    cat /usr/share/zoneminder/db/zm_create.sql | sudo mysql --defaults-file=/etc/mysql/debian.cnf

    echo 'grant lock tables,alter,create,index,select,insert,update,delete on zm.* to 'zmuser'@localhost identified by "zmpass";'\
    | sudo mysql --defaults-file=/etc/mysql/debian.cnf mysql

Hint: generate secure password with `pwgen` and update "/etc/zm/zm.conf"
accordingly.

The following command can help to ensure that zoneminder can read its
configuration file:

    chgrp -c www-data /etc/zm/zm.conf


Upgrading database
------------------

The database is updated automatically on installation. You should not need to take this step.

Assuming that database is on "localhost" then the following command can be
used to upgrade "zm" database:

    zmupdate.pl

Additional permissions may be required to perform upgrade:

    echo 'grant lock tables, create, alter on zm.* to 'zmuser'@localhost identified by "zmpass";'\
    | sudo mysql --defaults-file=/etc/mysql/debian.cnf mysql

The following command prints the current version of zoneminder database:

    echo 'select Value from Config where Name = "ZM_DYN_CURR_VERSION";' \
    | sudo mysql --defaults-file=/etc/mysql/debian.cnf --skip-column-names zm


Enabling service
----------------

By default Zoneminder service is not automatically started and needs to be
manually enabled once database is configured:

    sudo systemctl enable zoneminder.service


Web server set-up
-----------------

There are few manual steps to get the web interface working:

## Apache2

Apache can be configured as folder "/zm" using sample .conf:

    sudo a2enconf zoneminder

Alternatively Apache web site configuration template can be used to setup
zoneminder as "http://zoneminder":

    sudo cp -v /usr/share/doc/zoneminder/examples/apache.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/zoneminder.conf
    sudo a2ensite zoneminder

Common configuration steps for Apache2:

    sudo a2enmod cgi
    sudo service apache2 reload


## nginx / fcgiwrap

Nginx needs "php-fpm" package to support PHP and "fcgiwrap" package
for binary "cgi-bin" applications:

    sudo apt-get install php-fpm fcgiwrap

To enable a URL alias that makes Zoneminder available from

    http://yourserver/zm

the following line is to be added to "server" section of a web site
configuration:

    include /usr/share/doc/zoneminder/examples/nginx.conf;

For "default" web site it would be sufficient to include the above
statement to the file

    /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default

To avoid problems with feeds from multiple cameras "fcgiwrap" should be
configured to start at least as many processes as there are cameras.
It can be done by adjusting DAEMON_OPTS in "/etc/default/fcgiwrap".
Systemd users may be affected by the following bug:

    http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=792705


## Note:

When Zoneminder web site is running it may be necessary to set
Options/Paths/PATH_ZMS to "/zm/cgi-bin/nph-zms" or according to chosen web
site configuration.


Changing the location for images and events
-------------------------------------------

ZoneMinder is now able to be configured to use an alternative location for storing
events and images at compile time. This package makes use of that, so symlinks in
/usr/share/zoneminder/www are no longer necessary.

Access to /dev/video*
---------------------

For cameras which require access to /dev/video*, zoneminder may need the
www-data user added to the video group in order to see those cameras:

  adduser www-data video

Note that all web applications running on the zoneminder server will then have
access to all video devices on the system.
