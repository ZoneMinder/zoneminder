An Easy To Use Docker Image
===========================
If you are interested in trying out ZoneMinder quickly, user Dan Landon maintains an easy to use docker image for ZoneMinder. With a few simple configuration changes, it also provides complete Event Notification Server and Machine Learning hook support. Please follow instructions in his repository. He maintains two repositories:

* If you want to run the latest stable release, please use his `zoneminder machine learning repository <https://github.com/dlandon/zoneminder.machine.learning>`__.
* If you want to run the latest zoneminder master, please use his `zoneminder master repository <https://github.com/dlandon/zoneminder.master-docker>`__.

In both cases, instructions are provided in the repo README files.

If you are looking at building your own native (non docker) binary packages of ZoneMinder for your distro, please refer to the distro specific install guides or  :doc:`packpack`.
