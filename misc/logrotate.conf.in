# Sample logrotate file for ZoneMinder. Copy this to /etc/logrotate.d/zm or similar
# if you wish your system to prevent your log files from growing too large.
# You can remove the 'kill' of syslogd if you have another logrotate file that does
# this but in that case you will want this file run first, so it will need to be 
# named something lexically ahead of the other logrotate file, for example 0zm to
# ensure it is executed first.
