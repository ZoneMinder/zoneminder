=head1 NAME



=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl data type class for the XML Schema defined simpleType
FaultCodeOpenType from the namespace http://docs.oasis-open.org/ws-dd/ns/discovery/2009/01.





This type class is derived by union.

Derivation by union is not fully supported yet - value space constraints are
not checked yet.

The current implementation of union resorts to inheriting from the base type,
which means (quoted from the XML Schema specs): "If the <list> or <union>
alternative is chosen, then the simple ur-type definition."



=head1 METHODS

=head2 get_value / set_value
