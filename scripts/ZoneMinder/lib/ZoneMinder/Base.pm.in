=head1 NAME

ZoneMinder::Base - Base perl module for ZoneMinder

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use ZoneMinder::Base;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is the base module for the rest of the ZoneMinder modules. It is included by each of the other modules but serves no purpose other than to propagate the perl module version amongst the other modules. You will never need to use this module directly but if you write new ZoneMinder modules they should include it.

=head2 EXPORT

None by default.
