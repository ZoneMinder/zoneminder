      ZoneMinder can use two methods to authenticate users when

      where ZoneMinder provides facilities for users to log in and
      maintains track of their identity. The second method allows
      interworking with other methods such as http basic
      authentication which passes an independently authentication
      'remote' user via http. In this case ZoneMinder would use the
      supplied user without additional authentication provided such a
      user is configured in ZoneMinder.

      There are two methods for doing this. This first is to use a
      time limited hashed string which contains no direct username or
      password details, the second method is to pass the username and
      passwords around in plaintext. This method is not recommend
      except where you do not have the md5 libraries available on
      your system or you have a completely isolated system with no
      external access. You can also switch off authentication
      relaying if your system is isolated in other ways.

      When ZoneMinder is running in hashed authenticated mode it can

      hash. This adds an extra level of security as only requests
      from that address may use that authentication key. However in
      some circumstances, such as access over mobile networks, the
      requesting address can change for each request which will cause
      most requests to fail. This option allows you to control
      whether IP addresses are included in the authentication hash on
      your system. If you experience intermittent problems with
      authentication, switching this option off may help.

      The normal process for logging into ZoneMinder is via the login

      be desirable to allow access directly to one or more pages, for
      instance from a third party application. If this option is
      enabled then adding an 'auth' parameter to any request will
      include a shortcut login bypassing the login screen, if not
      already logged in. As authentication hashes are time and,
      optionally, IP limited this can allow short-term access to
      ZoneMinder screens from other web pages etc. In order to use
      this the calling application will have to generate the
      authentication hash itself and ensure it is valid. If you use
      this option you should ensure that you have modified the
      ZM_AUTH_HASH_SECRET to something unique to your system.

      ZoneMinder can add a timestamp to images in two ways. The
      default method, when this option is set, is that each image is
      timestamped immediately when captured and so the image held in
      memory is marked right away. The second method does not
      timestamp the images until they are either saved as part of an
      event or accessed over the web. The timestamp used in both
      methods will contain the same time as this is preserved along
      with the image. The first method ensures that an image is
      timestamped regardless of any other circumstances but will
      result in all images being timestamped even those never saved
      or viewed. The second method necessitates that saved images are
      copied before being saved otherwise two timestamps perhaps at
      different scales may be applied. This has the (perhaps)
      desirable side effect that the timestamp is always applied at
      the same resolution so an image that has scaling applied will
      still have a legible and correctly scaled timestamp.

      codes, which can also be used in the timestamp. While this works
      well for Linux, this does not work well for BSD operating systems.

      exclamation point (!), resolves the issue. Note this only affects

      reference image. There are two methods that are available for
      this. If this option is set then fast calculation which does
      not use any multiplication or division is used. This
      calculation is extremely fast, however it limits the possible
      blend percentages to 50%, 25%, 12.5%, 6.25%, 3.25% and 1.5%.

    description => 'Should frame analysis try and be efficient in skipping frames',
    help        => q`
      In previous versions of ZoneMinder the analysis daemon would
      attempt to keep up with the capture daemon by processing the
      last captured frame on each pass. This would sometimes have the
      undesirable side-effect of missing a chunk of the initial
      activity that caused the alarm because the pre-alarm frames
      would all have to be written to disk and the database before
      processing the next frame, leading to some delay between the
      first and second event frames. Setting this option enables a
      newer adaptive algorithm where the analysis daemon attempts to
      process as many captured frames as possible, only skipping
      frames when in danger of the capture daemon overwriting yet to
      be processed frames. This skip is variable depending on the
      size of the ring buffer and the amount of space left in it.
      Enabling this option will give you much better coverage of the
      beginning of alarms whilst biasing out any skipped frames
      towards the middle or end of the event. However you should be
      aware that this will have the effect of making the analysis
      daemon run somewhat behind the capture daemon during events and
      for particularly fast rates of capture it is possible for the
      adaptive algorithm to be overwhelmed and not have time to react
      to a rapid build up of pending frames and thus for a buffer
      overrun condition to occur.

      that it may obstruct normal operation. For this reason you
      should set the level carefully and cautiously until the degree

      This option allows you to specify a different target for debug

      normally be in /var/log and this is where debug will be

      temporarily redirect debug, and other logging output, to this
      file. This option is a simple filename and you are debugging
      several components then they will all try and write to the same
      file with undesirable consequences. Appending a '+' to the
      filename will cause the file to be created with a '.<pid>'
      suffix containing your process id. In this way debug from each
      run of a component is kept separate. This is the recommended
      setting as it will also prevent subsequent runs from
      overwriting the same log.

      cases it is easier to diagnose the error if a core file, which
      is a memory dump of the process at the time of the error, is
      created. This can be interactively analysed in the debugger and
      may reveal more or better information than that available from
      the logs. This option is recommended for advanced users only
      otherwise leave at the default. Note using this option to
      trigger core files will mean that there will be no indication
      in the binary logs that a process has died, they will just
      stop, however the zmdc log will still contain an entry. Also
      note that you may have to explicitly enable core file creation
      on your system via the 'ulimit -c' command or other means
      otherwise no file will be created regardless of the value of
      this option.

      Performance when using Video 4 Linux devices is usually best if

      ZM_CAPTURES_PER_FRAME option and you should normally change the

      If you are using cameras attached to a video capture card which

      additional image captures before one is selected as the

      capture rates. This option has no effect on (a) network
      cameras, or (b) where multiple inputs do not share a capture
      chip. This option addresses a similar problem to the

      When a monitor is running in a continuous recording mode
      (Recording=Always) events are usually closed after a fixed
      period of time (the section length). However when doing motion
      detection it is possible that an alarm may occur near the end of a
      section. This option controls what happens in this situation.~~
      ~~
      The 'time' setting means that the event will be
      closed when the time is an even multiple of the section length 
      regardless of alarm activity. So if the section length is 600 (10 minutes)
      and the time is 12:05, then the event will be closed at 12:10~~
      ~~
      The 'duration' setting means that the event will be
      closed when the event has reached its section length, regardless of the
      current time or alarm activity. If the section length is 600 (10 minutes)
      and the event started at 12:03, then the event will end at 12:13.
      ~~
      The 'idle' setting means that the event will be closed at the
      end of the section if there is no alarm activity occurring at
      the time otherwise it will be closed once the alarm is over
      meaning the event may end up being longer than the normal
      section length.~~
      ~~
      The 'alarm' setting means that if an alarm
      occurs during the event, the event will be closed and a new one
     will be opened.  So events will only be alarmed or continuous.
     This has the
      effect of limiting the number of alarms to one per event and
      the events may be shorter than the section length if an alarm
      has occurred.

      This can be used by the experimental motion tracking feature or

      tags which are able to give more information allowing the

      particular platform or player. This option controls whether
      media content is enclosed in EMBED tags only or whether, where

      future. It is suggested that you leave this option on unless

      When encoding real video via the ffmpeg library a bit rate can
      be specified which roughly corresponds to the available
      bandwidth used for the stream. This setting effectively
      corresponds to a 'quality' setting for the video. A low value
      will result in a blocky image whereas a high value will produce
      a clearer view. Note that this setting does not control the
      frame rate of the video however the quality of the video
      produced is affected both by this setting and the frame rate
      that the video is produced at. A higher frame rate at a
      particular bit rate result in individual frames being at a
      lower quality.

      When using streamed video the main control is the bitrate which
      determines how much data can be transmitted. However a lower
      bitrate at high frame rates results in a lower quality image.
      This option allows you to limit the maximum frame rate to
      ensure that video quality is maintained. An additional
      advantage is that encoding video at high frame rates is a
      processor intensive task when for the most part a very high
      frame rate offers little perceptible improvement over one that
      has a more manageable resource requirement. Note, this option
      is implemented as a cap beyond which binary reduction takes
      place. So if you have a device capturing at 15fps and set this
      option to 10fps then the video is not produced at 10fps, but
      rather at 7.5fps (15 divided by 2) as the final frame rate must
      be the original divided by a power of 2.

      ZoneMinder can be configured to use either mpeg encoded video

      This option defines which is used. If you choose mpeg you
      should ensure that you have the appropriate plugins available

      When encoding real video via the ffmpeg library a bit rate can
      be specified which roughly corresponds to the available
      bandwidth used for the stream. This setting effectively
      corresponds to a 'quality' setting for the video. A low value
      will result in a blocky image whereas a high value will produce
      a clearer view. Note that this setting does not control the
      frame rate of the video however the quality of the video
      produced is affected both by this setting and the frame rate
      that the video is produced at. A higher frame rate at a
      particular bit rate result in individual frames being at a
      lower quality.

    description => 'What the maximum frame rate for streamed video should be',
    help        => q`
      When using streamed video the main control is the bitrate which
      determines how much data can be transmitted. However a lower
      bitrate at high frame rates results in a lower quality image.
      This option allows you to limit the maximum frame rate to
      ensure that video quality is maintained. An additional
      advantage is that encoding video at high frame rates is a
      processor intensive task when for the most part a very high
      frame rate offers little perceptible improvement over one that
      has a more manageable resource requirement. Note, this option
      is implemented as a cap beyond which binary reduction takes
      place. So if you have a device capturing at 15fps and set this
      option to 10fps then the video is not produced at 10fps, but
      rather at 7.5fps (15 divided by 2) as the final frame rate must
      be the original divided by a power of 2.

      If unset, this option sends the whole image to the browser

      on the server before sending a reduced size image to the
      browser to conserve bandwidth at the cost of CPU on the server.

      PHP graphics functionality is installed. This is usually

      itself. This progress is calculated from the actual event
      duration and is not directly linked to the replay itself, so on
      limited bandwidth connections may be out of step with the
      replay. This option allows you to turn off the progress
      display, whilst still keeping the navigation aspect, where

      required after which requests are abandoned. A timeout may be
      necessary if requests would overwise hang such as on a slow
      connection. This would tend to consume a lot of browser memory
      and make the interface unresponsive. Ordinarily no requests
      should timeout so this setting should be set to a value greater
      than the slowest expected response. This value is in
      milliseconds but if set to zero then no timeout will be used.

=head1 NAME

ZoneMinder::ConfigData - ZoneMinder Configuration Data module

=head1 SYNOPSIS

use ZoneMinder::ConfigData;
use ZoneMinder::ConfigData qw(:all);

loadConfigFromDB();
saveConfigToDB();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The ZoneMinder:ConfigData module contains the master definition of the
ZoneMinder configuration options as well as helper methods. This module is
intended for specialist configuration management and would not normally be
used by end users.

The configuration held in this module, which was previously in zmconfig.pl,
includes the name, default value, description, help text, type and category
for each option, as well as a number of additional fields in a small number
of cases.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item loadConfigFromDB ();

Loads existing configuration from the database (if any) and merges it with
the definitions held in this module. This results in the merging of any new
configuration and the removal of any deprecated configuration while
preserving the existing values of every else.

=item saveConfigToDB ();

Saves configuration held in memory to the database. The act of loading and
saving configuration is a convenient way to ensure that the configuration
held in the database corresponds with the most recent definitions and that
all components are using the same set of configuration.

=back

=head2 EXPORT

None by default.
The :data tag will export the various configuration data structures
The :functions tag will export the helper functions.
The :all tag will export all above symbols.
