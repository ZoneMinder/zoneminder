GLYPHICONS Halflings font is also released as an extension of a Bootstrap www.getbootstrap.com for free and 
it is released under the same license as Bootstrap. While you are not required to include attribution on your 
Bootstrap-based projects, I would certainly appreciate any form of support, even a nice Tweet is enough. 
Of course if you want, you can say thank you and support me by buying more icons on GLYPHICONS.com.
