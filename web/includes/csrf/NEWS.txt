1.0.4 released 2013-07-17

  [SECURITY FIXES]

    - When secret key was not explicitly set, it was not being used
      by the csrf_hash() function.  Thanks sparticvs for reporting.

  [FEATURES]

    - The default 'CSRF check failed' page now offers a handy 'Try
      again' button, which resubmits the form.

  [BUG FIXES]

    - The fix for 1.0.3 inadvertantly turned off XMLHttpRequest
      overloading for all browsers; it has now been fixed to only
      apply to IE.

1.0.3 released 2012-01-31

 [BUG FIXES]

    - Internet Explorer 8 adds support for XMLHttpRequest.prototype,
      but this support is broken for method overloading.  We
      explicitly disable JavaScript overloading for Internet Explorer.
      Thanks Kelly Lu for reporting. <lubird@gmail.com>

    - A global declaration was omitted, resulting in a variable
      not being properly introduced in PHP 5.3.  Thanks Whitney Beck for
      reporting. <whitney.a.beck@gmail.com>

1.0.2 released 2009-03-08

 [SECURITY FIXES]

    - Due to a typo, csrf-magic accidentally treated the secret key
      as always present.  This means that there was a possible CSRF
      attack against users without any cookies.  No attacks in the
      wild were known at the time of this release.  Thanks Jakub
      Vrána for reporting.

1.0.1 released 2008-11-02

 [NEW FEATURES]

    - Support for composite tokens; this also fixes a bug with using
      IP-based tokens for users with cookies disabled.

    - Native support cookie tokens; use csrf_conf('cookie', $name) to
      specify the name of a cookie that the CSRF token should be
      placed in.  This is useful if you have a Squid cache, and need
      to configure it to ignore this token.

    - Tips/tricks section in README.txt.

    - There is now a two hour expiration time on all tokens.  This
      can be modified using csrf_conf('expires', $seconds).

    - ClickJacking protection using an iframe breaker.  Disable with
      csrf_conf('frame-breaker', false).

 [BUG FIXES]

    - CsrfMagic.send() incorrectly submitted GET requests twice,
      once without the magic token and once with the token.  Reported
      by Kelly Lu <lubird@gmail.com>.
