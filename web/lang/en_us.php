// ZoneMinder <your language> Translation by <your name>

// Notes for Translators
// 0. Get some credit, put your name in the line above (optional)
// 1. When composing the language tokens in your language you should try and keep to roughly the
//   same length text if possible. Abbreviate where necessary as spacing is quite close in a number of places.
// 2. There are four types of string replacement
//   a) Simple replacements are words or short phrases that are static and used directly. This type of
//     replacement can be used 'as is'.
//   b) Complex replacements involve some dynamic element being included and so may require substitution
//     or changing into a different order. The token listed in this file will be passed through sprintf as
//     a formatting string. If the dynamic element is a number you will usually need to use a variable
//     replacement also as described below.
//   c) Variable replacements are used in conjunction with complex replacements and involve the generation
//     of a singular or plural noun depending on the number passed into the zmVlang function. See the 
//     the zmVlang section below for a further description of this.
//   d) Optional strings which can be used to replace the prompts and/or help text for the Options section
//     of the web interface. These are not listed below as they are quite large and held in the database
//     so that they can also be used by the zmconfig.pl script. However you can build up your own list
//     quite easily from the Config table in the database if necessary.
// 3. The tokens listed below are not used to build up phrases or sentences from single words. Therefore
//   you can safely assume that a single word token will only be used in that context.
// 4. In new language files, or if you are changing only a few words or phrases it makes sense from a 
//   maintenance point of view to include the original language file and override the old definitions rather
//   than copy all the language tokens across. To do this change the line below to whatever your base language
//   is and uncomment it.
//
require_once('lang/en_gb.php');

// You may need to change the character set here, if your web server does not already
// do this by default, uncomment this if required.
//
// Example
// header( "Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1" );
